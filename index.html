        Hi, I'm Kim
        I am a first year master <em>Integrated Product Design</em> student at <strong>TU Delft</strong>, who loves to learn things.
        Pushing myself out of my comfort zone is one of my favourite things to do. Not long ago I discovered that everything is learnable, that is why I keep on forcing myself to try new things out. 
    
        Over the years my interests will never stay the same as long as there are still untried activities. 
        I like to apply this trait to my work. I believe that there is always a better way to do something and 
        that I can always improve my skills or learn new ones.
